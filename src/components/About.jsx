                I come from a family of programmers, so you could say coding runs in my blood! However, my real inspiration comes from my passion for learningâ€”exploring new technologies and solving challenges excites me. Once I started programming, I knew it was something I wanted to pursue.

                Right now, Iâ€™m focused on becoming a web developer. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks like Tailwind and SCSS. While Iâ€™ve built projects for my own learning, Iâ€™m eager to apply my skills to real-world applications. In just two weeks, I created three websites, constantly pushing myself to grow and improve.

                One of my biggest strengths is adaptability. Iâ€™m always willing to learn and take on new challenges, whether independently or as part of a team. I thrive in friendly, positive environments where mentorship and collaboration drive growth. At the same time, I enjoy taking initiative and helping teammates when I can.
            </p>
            <p className='text-xl mt-4 text-justify'>
                Beyond coding, I enjoy reading (mostly romance novels) and playing logic-based games like chess, Sudoku, and Tetris. Iâ€™m also fascinated by AI and hope to explore how it can improve peopleâ€™s everyday lives. My ultimate goal is to create technology that makes life easier and more efficient for others.
